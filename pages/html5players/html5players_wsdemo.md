1. To play streams from EMS using webSocket, the following command needs to be executed first on EMS. Access the test page `demo/evowsvideo.html`:

   ```
   http://<WEBSERVER_IP_ADDRESS>/demo/evowsvideo.html
   ```

   Enter the Webserver's IP address and the stream name of the stream you want to play

   The video will play automatically once it has successfully connected with EMS.
