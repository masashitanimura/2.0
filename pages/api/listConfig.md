Returns a list with all push/pull configurations.

Whenever the `pullStream` or `pushStream` interfaces are called, a record containing the details of the pull or push is created in the pullpushconfig.xml file. Then, the next time the EMS is started, the pullpushconfig.xml file is read, and the EMS attempts to reconnect all of the previous pulled or pushed streams.
