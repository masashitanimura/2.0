## API Parameter Table

|    Parameter Name    |  Type   | Mandatory |              Default Value               | Description                              |
| :------------------: | :-----: | :-------: | :--------------------------------------: | ---------------------------------------- |
|   localStreamNames   | string  |   true    |                  *null*                  | The stream(s) that will be used as the input. This is a comma-delimited list of active stream names (local stream names) |
|     targetFolder     | string  |   true    |                  *null*                  | The folder where all the *.ts/*.m3u8 files will be stored. This folder must be accessible by the HLS clients. It is usually in the web-root of the server |
|      keepAlive       | boolean |   false   |                 1 *true*                 | If **true**, the EMS will attempt to reconnect to the stream source if the connection is severed |
| overwriteDestination | boolean |   false   |                 1 *true*                 | If **true**, it will force overwrite of destination files |

This will be the size of file before chunking it to another file, this replace the`chunkLength` in case of EXT-X-BYTERANGE, since `chunkLength` will be the byte range chunk |
|    useSystemTime     | boolean |   false   |                0 *false*                 | If **true**, uses UTC in playlist time stamp otherwise will use the local server time |
|      offsetTime      | integer |   false   |                    0                     | The offset in seconds to start playing the video |
|     startOffset      | integer |   false   |                    0                     | A parameter valid only for HLS v.6 onwards. This will indicate the start offset time (in seconds) for the playback of the playlist |

------

## Notes

- Make sure that **HLS version** is properly configured in config.lua before running EMS
- If you wan't your playlist to start at the very beginning, issue the `createHLSStream` first before `pullStream` command
- If using autoHLS, take note that the following parameter values will not be modified:
  - keepAlive - will always be false
  - cleanupDestination - will always be true
  - createMasterPlaylist - will always be false
  - overwriteDestination - will always be true
  - playlistType - will always be "rolling"
