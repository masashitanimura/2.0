#### JSON Response

The JSON response contains the following details:

- data – The data to parse
  - appName -  The name of the application using the service
  - audio – stats about the audio portion of the stream
    - bytesCount - Total amount of audio data received
    - codec - The name of the audio codec 
    - codecNumeric - Code used for internal use only
    - droppedBytesCount - The number of video bytes lost
    - droppedPacketsCount – The number of lost audio packets
    - packetsCount – Total number of audio packets received
  - bandwidth – The current bandwidth utilization of the stream
  - connectionType - ??
  - creationTimestamp – The UNIX timestamp for when the stream was created. UNIX time is expressed as the number of seconds since the UNIX Epoch (Jan 1, 1970)
  - farIp - The IP address of the distant party
  - farPort - The port used by the distant party
  - ip - IP address of the source stream’s host
  - name – the `localStreamName` for this stream.
  - nearIp - The IP address used by the local computer
  - nearPort - The port used by the local computer
  - outStreamsUniqueIDs – *For pulled streams*. An array of the “out” stream IDs associated with this “in” stream
  - pageUrl - A link to the page that originated the request (often unused)
  - port - The port bound to the service
  - processID - ??
  - preocessType - ??
  - pullSettings/pushSettings – Not present for streams requested by a 3rd party (IE player/client). A copy of the parameters used in the `pullStream` or `pushStream` command.
    - _callback - ??
    - audioCodecBytes - The audio codec setup of this RTP stream if it is audio
    - configId – The identifier for the pullPushConfig.xml entry
    - emulateUserAgent – The string that the EMS uses to identify itself with the other server. It can be modified so that EMS identifies itself as, say, a Flash Media Server
    - forceTcp – Whether TCP MUST be used, or if UDP can be used
    - httpProxy - May either be IP:Port combination or self
    - isAudio - Indicates if the currently pulled stream is an audio source
    - keepAlive – If true, the stream will try to reconnect if the connection is severed
    - localStreamName – Same as the above “name” field
    - operationType – The type of operation
    - pageUrl – A link to the page that originated the request (often unused)
    - ppsBytes - The video PPS bytes of this RTP stream if it is video
    - rangeEnd - The length in seconds for the playback
    - rangeStart - A value from which the playback should start expressed in seconds
    - rtcpDetectionInterval – Used for RTSP. This is the time period the EMS waits to determine if an RTCP connection is available for the RTSP/RTP stream. (RTSP is used for synchronization between audio and video)
    - sendRenewStream - If 1, the server will send RenewStream via SET_PARAMETER when a new client connects
    - spsBytes - The video SPS bytes of this RTP stream if it is video
    - swfUrl – The location of the Flash Client that is generating the stream (if any)
    - tcUrl – An RTMP parameter that is essentially a copy of the URI
    - tos – Type of Service network flag
    - ttl – Time To Live network flag
    - uri – The parsed values of the source streams URI
  - queryTimestamp – The time (in UNIX seconds) when the information in this request was populated
  - serverAgent - ??
  - swfUrl - The location of the Flash Client that is generating the stream (if any)
  - tcUrl - An RTMP parameter that is essentially a copy of the URI
  - type – The type of stream this is. The first two characters are of most interest:
    - char 1 = I for inbound, O for outbound
    - char 2 = N for network, F for file
    - char 3+ = further details about stream
    - example: INR = Inbound Network Stream (a stream coming from the network into the EMS)
  - typeNumeric - ??
  - uniqueId – The unique ID of the stream (integer)
  - upTime – The time in seconds that the stream has been alive/running for.
  - video – Stats about the video portion of the stream
    - bytesCount - Total amount of video data received
    - codec - The name of the video codec 
    - codecNumeric - Code used for internal use only.
    - droppedBytesCount – The number of video bytes lost
    - droppedPacketsCount – The number of lost video packets
    - height - The video stream’s pixel height
    - level - ??
    - packetsCount – Total number of video packets received
    - profile - ??
    - width - The video stream’s pixel width
- description – Describes the result of parsing/executing the command
- status – **SUCCESS** if the command was parsed and executed successfully, **FAIL** if not.
