**Note:** There will be no software changes but the AWS infrastructure charges still apply.



## Deployment

To get started with the EvoStream Media Server (EMS) on Amazon EC2 you will first need to purchase an EMS instance through the Amazon Web Services [website](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace).

1. Search for the EvoStream Media Server in the AWS marketplace, or simply follow this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00VTR946Y)

   ![](images/emscloud/image1.JPG)

2. Click **Continue** and **Sign in** your AWS account

   ​

3. Launch EMS using **1-Click Launch** or **Manual Launch**

   ​

### 1-Click Launch

![](images/emscloud/1click.JPG)

**How To:**

A.	Select the **Version** of the EMS to be used

![](images/emscloud/image4.JPG)

B.	Select the **Region** and **EC2 Instance Type** (size of computer) for your deployment

![](images/emscloud/region.jpg)

![](images/emscloud/image5.JPG)



**Note:**  The EMS can be run on very small computers, including Micro EC2 instances. The size of the instance should be a direct reflection of how much sustained traffic you expect to be hosting. In almost all scenarios you will run out of bandwidth prior to exhausting the CPU or memory limits of the virtual machine. Take note that availability of sizes depends on the Region.



C.	Select or create the **VPC Settings** to be used.

**Note:** See Amazon documentation on [VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html) for more information.



D.	Choose a **Security Group**

![](images/emscloud/image7.JPG)



**Create new based on seller settings** - a new security group will be generated by AWS Marketplace. It is based on recommended settings of EMS

![](images/emscloud/secgroup.JPG)



The security group has been designed to provide outside access to all ports used for streaming. The ports are defined and used as follows:

| **Port** | **Use**                  |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| 22       | SSH                      |
| 1112     | inboundJsonCli           |
| 1113     | inboundBinVariant        |
| 1222     | inboundAsciiCli          |
| 1935     | inboundRtmp              |
| 1936     | inboundRtmp (clustering) |
| 3389     | RDP                      |
| 4000     | webservicesPort          |
| 4100     | webuiPort                |
| 4443     | inboundRtmps (optional)  |
| 5000     | Reserved                 |
| 5544     | inboundRtsp              |
| 5985     | Reserved                 |
| 6666     | inboundLiveFlv           |
| 7777     | inboundHttpJsonCli       |
| 8100     | inboundJsonMeta          |
| 8210     | wsJsonMeta               |
| 8410     | inboundWSFMP4            |
| 8420     | inboundWSSFMP4           |
| 8433     | wssJsonMeta              |
| 8888     | webserver                |
| 9898     | inboundUdTps             |
| 9998     | inboundTcpTs             |
| 9999     | inboundHttpFmp4          |

These Security Settings can be changed but it will impact the accessibility of the streams on your server.

**Note:** See Amazon documentation on [Security Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html#default-security-group) for more information.



E.	Choose or create a **Key Pair**

Either choose an existing key pair for instance access or create a new one for your account. If you choose an existing pair you **MUST** have the .pem file already downloaded from that pair. Amazon does not allow you to download key pairs a second time.

**Note:** See Amazon documentation on [Key Pairs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) for more information.
