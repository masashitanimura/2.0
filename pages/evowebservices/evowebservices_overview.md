This document provides instructions on how to use the EvoStream Media Server (EMS) Web Services. It will cover the basics of starting the web services as well as some advanced topics like modifying configuration files.

This document is written for users of the EMS Web Services. It is expected that you have a basic understanding of multimedia streaming and the technologies required to perform multimedia streaming.



## What are EMS Web Services?

EMS Web Services are a suite of scripts which can be hosted by any Web Server and that leverage the EMS’s Event Notification System and Runtime-APIs. The EMS Web Services provide a convenient way to extend and customize the EMS for your projects and environments.



## Why use the EMS Web Services?

The EMS Web Services are tools which use of the EMS Event Notification System together with the Runtime APIs to create custom stream processing. These scripts (functions that simply wrap the HTTP interface calls of the Runtime APIs) can be used in your production environment and can be modified to meet your specific needs. The source code for all web services are provided for you to use, modify and extend!

### How does it work?

The EMS Web Services are web application scripts that run with the EMS’ Event Notification System and use the EMS Runtime APIs to create automated stream processing. Each web service provides a unique set of features and can be combined to create aggregate effects.
